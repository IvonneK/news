This is a News web scraper app

When a user visits the site, the app scrapes stories from a news outlet of your choice. The data has a link to the story and a headline.  Cheerio is used to grab the site content and Mongoose is used to save it to your MongoDB database. 

All users can leave comments on the stories you collect. They can delete whatever comments they want removed. All stored comments should be visible to every user.

Used Mongoose's model system to associate comments with particular articles.
